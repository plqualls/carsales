12/12/20

1.	Project Background and Description
 	Our group will explore and analyze the critical factors such as Covid-19, unemployment, interest rates, and the stock market regarding car sales volume changes.  We will also analyze automobile brands as it pertains to their standing in the stock market.

2.	The questions below will be explored:
•	What factors explain changes in car sales?
•	How are certain factors, such as Covid-19, affecting automobile brands?
•	Are interest rates (bank discounts) affecting the volume of car sales?
•	Did all automobile segments change the same – luxury, mid-range, and economy vehicles?
•	Is there a correlation between car sales and stock price?
•	Do consumer sentiments play a part in car sales? If so, how much?

3.	Data Visualizations
 	
•	Bar chart for the volume of car sales by brand
•	Bar chart for price segment car sales (average price per brand)
•	Line chart for the volume of car sales

•	Line chart for Covid-19 cases
•	Scatter plot for Covid-19 cases per state

•	Line plot for displaying interest rates
•	Line plot for displaying unemployment rates
•	Line plot for displaying consumer sentiment rates

•	The team created weighted average indexes of the targeted twenty-one auto groups to compare to overall S&P 500 performance and to one another.  The four indexes' performance differed from one another and from the S&P 500.
